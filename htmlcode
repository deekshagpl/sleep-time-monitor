		   Sleepytime helps you figure out when to go to sleep and when to wake up, by estimating sleep cycles based on 90 minutes each.
		   To put it simply, a sleep cycle is what your brain does while you’re getting your zzz’s.
		   As you sleep, your brain goes through various patterns of activity. 
		   These patterns are based on distinct eye movements and muscle activity. 
		   In fact, sleep scientists have tracked these movements and found two main sleep cycle categories:rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep.

		   To put HOW LONG IS A SLEEP CYCLE?</h3>
		   
           <h1><center>  Your natural sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes. During this time your brain moves through five different stages.</center></h1>
		   <p>
		   <ol>
		   <h3>
		   <li>Your brain begins to slow down. You are lightly sleeping, drifting in and out.</li>
           <li>Your eye movement stops and the brain begins to relax. This is a period of light sleep before you enter a deep sleep.</li>
		   <li>Your brain waves begin to slow even more. They are preparing for the deepest stages of sleep.</li>
           <li>This is the deepest stage of sleep. It’s important for you to reach this stage for a good night’s sleep and it’s also important that you are not awoken during this stage. That will make for a very grouchy morning.</li>
           <li>This is the rapid-eye-movement (REM) stage of sleep. Most of your dreaming occurs during this time. Again, make sure you are not awoken during this stage because you will likely feel disoriented.</li>
