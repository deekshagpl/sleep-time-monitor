<p>Do you sometimes wake up groggy?
    <br />
    Waking up on the wrong side of the bed may be less about how much shuteye you get and more about where you are in
    your sleep cycle when you awaken. Humans experience multiple cycles while asleep, and waking in the middle of the
    wrong one could cause drowsiness. Therefore, you should know how much rest you need to avoid waking mid-cycle, and
    the good news is we are here to help. We’ll walk you through how to use our sleep calculator to maximize your rest.
    Plus, we’ll go over what happens while you sleep, why quality rest is important, and more.

    <ul>
        <li>Most adults need 7 or more hours of good-quality sleep on a regular schedule each night.</li>

        <li>Getting enough sleep isn’t only about total hours of sleep. It’s also important to get good-quality sleep on
            a regular schedule so you feel rested when you wake up.</li>

        <li>If you often have trouble sleeping — or if you often still feel tired after sleeping — talk with your
            doctor.</li>
